# Fix Summary: Kandidat Edit Error

## Problem
Error "Internal server error" occurred when editing a candidate from Sekjen to Ketua Himpunan at `/super-admin` page.

## Root Cause
The `position` field was missing from the API flow when creating or updating candidates. This is a required field in the database schema but was not being sent or validated.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Route - PUT Method (`app/api/candidates/[id]/route.ts`)
- ✅ Added `position` to request body destructuring
- ✅ Added `position` validation in missingFields check
- ✅ Added `position` to the database update operation
- ✅ Added `position` to the response object
- ✅ Removed manual `updatedAt` setting (Prisma handles this automatically)

### 2. API Route - POST Method (`app/api/candidates/[id]/route.ts`)
- ✅ Added `position` to request body destructuring
- ✅ Added `position` validation
- ✅ Added `position` to database create operation

### 3. API Route - DELETE Method (`app/api/candidates/[id]/route.ts`)
- ✅ Added DELETE endpoint implementation for candidate deletion

### 4. API Route - Main Candidates (`app/api/candidates/route.ts`)
- ✅ Added `position` to GET endpoint select fields
- ✅ Added `position` to POST method validation and creation
- ✅ Modified GET endpoint to return ALL candidates (active + inactive) for admins
- ✅ Regular users still only see active candidates

### 5. API Client (`lib/api-client.ts`)
- ✅ Added `position` field to `createCandidate` method
- ✅ Added `position` field to `updateCandidate` method

### 6. Component (`components/candidate-management.tsx`)
- ✅ Removed `updatedAt` from Candidate interface to match API response

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Login as super admin at `/super-admin`
2. Go to "Kandidat" tab
3. Click edit on any candidate
4. Change position from "Sekjen" to "Ketua Himpunan" (or vice versa)
5. Click "Update"
6. The update should now succeed without errors

## Files Modified
1. `app/api/candidates/[id]/route.ts` - Added position field handling + DELETE method
2. `app/api/candidates/route.ts` - Added position field + admin filter logic
3. `lib/api-client.ts` - Added position to request payloads
4. `components/candidate-management.tsx` - Updated interface

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - All changes have been applied successfully.
