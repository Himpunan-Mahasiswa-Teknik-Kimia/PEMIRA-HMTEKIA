# Fix: Voting Status Not Updating in Super Admin UI

## Problem
When a voter (e.g., voter1@pemira.local) successfully votes for both Ketua Himpunan and Sekjen, their voting status in the Super Admin page's Users tab still shows "Belum Vote" instead of "Sudah Vote".

## Root Cause Analysis

### Backend Logic (CORRECT ‚úÖ)
The vote endpoint (`/api/vote/route.ts`) correctly updates the `hasVoted` field:
1. When a user votes, it creates a vote record
2. It checks if the user has voted for both positions (KETUA_HIMPUNAN and SEKJEN)
3. If yes, it updates `user.hasVoted = true` in a database transaction

This logic is working correctly.

### Frontend Issue (BUG FOUND üêõ)
The **UserManagement component** (`components/user-management.tsx`) was missing auto-refresh functionality:
- It only loads user data on initial component mount
- It doesn't automatically refresh to show updated voting statuses
- Users have to manually click the "Refresh" button to see updates

Meanwhile, the super-admin Overview tab DOES have auto-refresh (every 15 seconds), but this only refreshes dashboard statistics, NOT the Users tab data.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Auto-Refresh to UserManagement Component
**File:** `components/user-management.tsx`

Added automatic data refresh every 10 seconds:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  loadUsers()

  // Set up auto-refresh every 10 seconds to update voting status in real-time
  const interval = setInterval(() => {
    loadUsers()
  }, 10000) // Refresh every 10 seconds

  return () => {
    clearInterval(interval)
  }
}, [])
```

**Benefits:**
- Voting status updates automatically within 10 seconds
- No need to manually refresh the page
- Real-time monitoring of voter participation

### 2. Enhanced Logging in Vote Endpoint
**File:** `app/api/vote/route.ts`

Added detailed console logging to help debug any future issues:
```javascript
console.log('‚úÖ Vote created:', { voteId: vote.id, userId: user.id, position })
console.log('üìä Total votes for user:', userVotes.length, 'positions:', userVotes.map(v => v.position))

if (userVotes.length >= 2) {
  console.log('‚úÖ User has completed voting for both positions, updating hasVoted status')
  // ... update logic
  console.log('‚úÖ User hasVoted status updated to true')
} else {
  console.log('‚ÑπÔ∏è User has voted for', userVotes.length, 'position(s), waiting for both positions')
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Easy to debug voting flow in server logs
- Track when `hasVoted` status is updated
- Identify any potential transaction issues

## How It Works Now

### Voting Flow
1. **Voter votes for first position (e.g., Ketua Himpunan)**
   - Vote is recorded
   - `hasVoted` remains `false` (needs to vote for both positions)
   - Log: "‚ÑπÔ∏è User has voted for 1 position(s), waiting for both positions"

2. **Voter votes for second position (e.g., Sekjen)**
   - Vote is recorded
   - System detects user has voted for both positions
   - `hasVoted` is updated to `true`
   - Voting session is marked as used
   - Log: "‚úÖ User has completed voting for both positions, updating hasVoted status"

3. **Super Admin sees the update**
   - Within 10 seconds, the Users tab automatically refreshes
   - Voter's status changes from "Belum Vote" to "Sudah Vote"
   - Stats counters update automatically

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Login as a voter (e.g., voter1@pemira.local)
2. Generate QR code and get it validated by admin
3. Vote for Ketua Himpunan
4. Vote for Sekjen
5. Open Super Admin page ‚Üí Users tab
6. **Wait up to 10 seconds** (automatic refresh)
7. ‚úÖ Voter status should now show "Sudah Vote"

Alternatively, check server logs to see the detailed voting flow.

## Files Modified
1. `components/user-management.tsx` - Added auto-refresh (10 second interval)
2. `app/api/vote/route.ts` - Enhanced logging for debugging

## Configuration
- **Refresh Interval:** 10 seconds (adjustable in `user-management.tsx` line 43)
- **Dashboard Refresh:** 15 seconds (super-admin page overview, unchanged)

## Status
‚úÖ **FIXED** - Voting status now updates automatically in the Super Admin UI within 10 seconds.
